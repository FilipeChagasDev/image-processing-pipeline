## Brief
**Image Processing Pipeline (IPP)** is a Python image processing helper.

This program processes images through a pipeline architecture, where the filters are arranged as pipes and connected by buses.

This program can be integrated into another Python application as a library.

## Dependencies
* Python v3
* NumPy
* OpenCV (cv2)
